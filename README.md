# Project3-Trelp
Full CRUD action with Angular


# About the Project

Trelp is a web application that allows users to keep track of their trips, and share their comments on each location they have  visited with other users.  

# User Story

- As an anonymous user, I can:
- Sign up and create a new user account.
- I can login into my account and add, and update the list of the locations that I have been, so I can keep track of my travel history. I am also able to leave comments on each travel, and share my experience with other visitors of the website. In addition, I can Search for a location so I can see who else has been there.
- I can Sign Out at the end of the session so someone else doesnâ€™t mess with my account.


# Necessary Deliverables

- A working full-stack application, hosted on Heroku
- A link to the hosted working app in the Github repo
- A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- Wireframes of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
- A link in readme.md to the publicly-accessible user stories you created.

# Approach Taken

1. We started by drawing out our Wireframes using wireframe.cc.
2. We made a planning board using Trello to keep track of the progress of the project.
3. We created models, views, and controllers for the app. Full CRUD was achieved using Angular JavaScript.
4. Lastly, after all the debugging, the app was deployed to Heroku.

# Future Implementations

- Add Images as a visual reference to each location that the user has visited.
- Add a rating for each trip and  show average ratings for a place when the user search for a place.
- Add description, extra information about the location that a user has been to.
- Follow another user.
- Contact another user.
