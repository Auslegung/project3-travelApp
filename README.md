# project3-travelApp
Full CRUD action with Angular


#About the Project

Trelp is a web application that allows users to keep track of their trips, and share their comments on each location they have  visited with other users.  

#User Story

-As an anonymous user, I can:
-Sign up and create a new user account.
-I can login into my account and add, and update the list of the locations that I have been, so I can keep track of my travel history.  I am also able to leave comments on each travel, and share my experience with other visitors of the website. In addition, I can Search for a location so I can see who else has been there.
-I can Sign Out at the end of the session so someone else doesn’t mess with my account.


#Project Requirements

-Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) – one representing someone using your application (a user), and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
-Use Angular as a front-end framework
Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow. (Using Passport)
-Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
-Write Mongo queries using the Mongoose module and interact with your document database. Promises will likely make your life easier as you start to build complex queries!
-Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
-Include User Stories
-Include ERDs
-Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
-Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku.


#Necessary Deliverables

-A working full-stack application, hosted on Heroku
-A link to the hosted working app in the Github repo
-A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
-Wireframes of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
-A link in readme.md to the publicly-accessible user stories you created.

#Approach Taken

1- We started by drawing out our Wireframes using wireframe.cc.
2- We made a planning board using Trello to keep track of the progress of the project.
3- We created models, views, and controllers for the app. Full CRUD was achieved using Angular JavaScript.
4- Lastly, after all the debugging, the app was deployed to Heroku.

#Future Implementations

- Add Images as a visual reference to each location that the user has visited.
- Add a rating for each trip and  show average ratings for a place when the user search for a place.
- Add description, extra information about the location that a user has been to.
- Follow another user.
- Contact another user.
